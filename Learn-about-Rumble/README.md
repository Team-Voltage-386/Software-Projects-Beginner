# Learn about rumble
Everything to do with rumbling the controllers.

## About
This is a test project exploring how to rumble the controllers and how that rumble feels while holding the controller.

## How to use
This project is set-up with a few button bindings.
* b
    * While holding this button, the whole controller rumbles at full power.
    * Releasing the button after hold stops the rumble
* a
    * While holding this button, the left and right of the controller will pulse every so-often (see below)
    * Releasing the button after hold stops the rumble
    * Using Smart Dashboard, you can configure three parameters
        * The intensity of the right rumble `[0, 1]` (0 is off, 1 is full rumble of the right of the controller)
        * The intensity of the left rumble `[0, 1]` (0 is off, 1 is full rumble of the left of the controller)
        * The time between pulses `[0, 10]` (the pulse duration in seconds)
