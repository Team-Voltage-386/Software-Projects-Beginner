# Project to set the voltage on a single motor
Shuffleboard includes display of what the motor is currently doing as well as allowing the user to change the voltage.

Goal is for users can get an intuitive feel of how changes in voltage affect the speed of the motor.
Next project to tackle is Basic Motor Control Arm FeedForward.
