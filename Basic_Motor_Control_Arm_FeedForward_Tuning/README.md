# Project: control an arm with feedforward
Originally created for the arm on a stick connected to the mecanum wheeled frame and connected to the Demo board

The goal is to get the arm to move from hanging down to  parallel to the floor using Feed Forward to compensate for friction in the system and gravity.

To achieve this goal, you turn Feed Forward in shuffleboard (kS, kG, kV).
